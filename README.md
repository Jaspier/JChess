# JChess
A Simple Chess Engine written in Java.

A fun way for me to refresh myself on Java and OOP Concepts :)

Focused on maintaining immutability and writing robust secure code.

This is by no means supposed the most optimal way to write a chess engine
but is more for learning and reinforcing good coding practice.
